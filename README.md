- **Performance Booster**: Recommended configuration delivers a [30% boost](#Tests) to MySQL performance compare to the default configuration.
- **Simplified Monitoring**: [MySQL Health Checks](https://releem.com/blog/mysql-health-checks?utm_source=github&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=mysql-health-checks&utm_content=post) greatly simplifies the process of monitoring and maintaining a healthy database by focusing on key aspects that describe the efficiency and "best practices" of using Memory, Connections, Logs, Cache, Disk, Indexes, and Threads. Releem Score metric calculates by summarizing Health Checks statuses.

## How it works

**Releem Agent** - Has been installed on servers, collects MySQL metrics, sends them to Cloud Platforms, and applies MySQL configurations. Open Source daemon built on Go.

**Releem Cloud Platform** - Analyzes collected metrics, detects performance issues, and recommends MySQL configurations.

**Releem Customer Portal** - Web interface displays recommended configurations and current information about all MySQL servers with installed Releem Agent. It looks like this on the screenshot.

## Tests
We tested the results with Sysbench on a virtual server running Debian 9 (2 CPU, 2GB Ram) the table contained 10 million entries.
Two configurations were tested, the MySQL default configuration and the configuration recommended by the **Releem** service. The tests were two-step: read (test1) only and read/write (test2).

Recommended configuration delivered a 30% boost to MySQL performance compared to the default configuration.
